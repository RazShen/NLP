In/DT a/DT letter/DT to/DT subcommittee/DT Chairman/DT James/DT Oberstar/DT (/DT D./DT ,/DT Minn./DT )/DT ,/DT Mr./DT Trump/DT criticized/DT the/DT bill/DT as/DT an/DT explicit/DT effort/DT to/DT thwart/DT his/DT bid/DT for/DT AMR/DT ,/DT and/DT said/DT it/DT contributed/DT to/DT the/DT collapse/DT of/DT the/DT deal/DT ./DT
Elaine/DT Chao/DT ,/DT deputy/DT transportation/DT secretary/DT ,/DT also/DT sent/DT a/DT letter/DT to/DT express/DT the/DT administration/DT 's/DT opposition/DT to/DT the/DT bill/DT ``/DT in/DT its/DT present/DT form/DT ./DT ''/DT
Rep./DT Oberstar/DT brushed/DT off/DT Mr./DT Trump/DT 's/DT allegations/DT as/DT an/DT ``/DT excuse/DT for/DT his/DT own/DT deal/DT failing/DT ./DT ''/DT
He/DT also/DT said/DT the/DT fact/DT that/DT the/DT other/DT letter/DT had/DT n't/DT come/DT from/DT Transportation/DT Secretary/DT Samuel/DT Skinner/DT indicated/DT there/DT is/DT ``/DT wiggle/DT room/DT ''/DT in/DT the/DT administration/DT 's/DT position/DT ./DT
Mr./DT Oberstar/DT and/DT other/DT committee/DT members/DT repeatedly/DT stressed/DT that/DT the/DT legislation/DT was/DT n't/DT a/DT response/DT to/DT any/DT particular/DT market/DT situation/DT ./DT
But/DT they/DT cited/DT the/DT UAL/DT and/DT AMR/DT examples/DT as/DT reasons/DT to/DT move/DT quickly/DT to/DT enact/DT this/DT legislation/DT ./DT
Aides/DT both/DT in/DT the/DT House/DT and/DT Senate/DT said/DT the/DT withdrawal/DT of/DT the/DT Trump/DT bid/DT for/DT AMR/DT is/DT n't/DT likely/DT to/DT deflate/DT efforts/DT to/DT push/DT the/DT legislation/DT ./DT
``/DT It/DT 's/DT still/DT on/DT the/DT fast/DT track/DT and/DT we/DT still/DT want/DT to/DT do/DT it/DT ,/DT ''/DT said/DT one/DT Senate/DT aide/DT ./DT
The/DT bill/DT is/DT aimed/DT at/DT addressing/DT the/DT concern/DT that/DT an/DT airline/DT might/DT sacrifice/DT costly/DT safety/DT measures/DT to/DT pay/DT off/DT the/DT debt/DT incurred/DT in/DT a/DT leveraged/DT buy-out/DT ./DT
Currently/DT ,/DT the/DT transportation/DT secretary/DT does/DT n't/DT have/DT clearly/DT established/DT authority/DT to/DT block/DT mergers/DT ,/DT but/DT can/DT take/DT the/DT drastic/DT step/DT of/DT revoking/DT the/DT operating/DT certificate/DT of/DT any/DT carrier/DT the/DT official/DT considers/DT unfit/DT ./DT

In/DT general/DT ,/DT the/DT bill/DT would/DT give/DT the/DT Transportation/DT Department/DT a/DT 30-day/DT review/DT period/DT before/DT 15/DT %/DT or/DT more/DT of/DT the/DT voting/DT stock/DT of/DT a/DT major/DT U.S./DT air/DT carrier/DT could/DT be/DT acquired/DT ./DT
It/DT also/DT would/DT require/DT the/DT acquiring/DT party/DT to/DT notify/DT the/DT transportation/DT secretary/DT and/DT to/DT provide/DT all/DT information/DT relevant/DT to/DT determining/DT the/DT intent/DT of/DT the/DT acquisition/DT ./DT
The/DT bill/DT would/DT allow/DT the/DT secretary/DT to/DT reject/DT a/DT buy-out/DT if/DT sufficient/DT information/DT has/DT n't/DT been/DT provided/DT ,/DT or/DT if/DT the/DT buy-out/DT is/DT likely/DT to/DT weaken/DT the/DT carrier/DT financially/DT ,/DT result/DT in/DT a/DT substantial/DT reduction/DT in/DT size/DT of/DT the/DT airline/DT through/DT disposal/DT of/DT assets/DT ,/DT or/DT give/DT control/DT to/DT a/DT foreign/DT interest/DT ./DT
If/DT more/DT information/DT is/DT needed/DT ,/DT the/DT secretary/DT would/DT have/DT authority/DT to/DT extend/DT the/DT review/DT period/DT 20/DT days/DT ./DT
All/DT the/DT witnesses/DT ,/DT both/DT congressmen/DT and/DT industry/DT experts/DT ,/DT expressed/DT support/DT for/DT the/DT bill/DT in/DT order/DT to/DT prevent/DT profiteers/DT from/DT cashing/DT in/DT on/DT airline/DT profits/DT at/DT the/DT expense/DT of/DT safe/DT ,/DT cost-effective/DT service/DT ./DT
But/DT several/DT committee/DT members/DT disapproved/DT ,/DT some/DT backing/DT Mr./DT Trump/DT 's/DT claim/DT that/DT the/DT threat/DT of/DT regulation/DT caused/DT the/DT failure/DT of/DT the/DT UAL/DT deal/DT and/DT the/DT stock-market/DT plunge/DT ./DT
One/DT of/DT the/DT major/DT concerns/DT expressed/DT by/DT the/DT dissenters/DT was/DT that/DT large/DT airlines/DT would/DT be/DT prohibited/DT from/DT divesting/DT themselves/DT of/DT smaller/DT entities/DT and/DT producing/DT independent/DT spin-off/DT companies/DT ./DT

What/DT happened/DT Friday/DT shows/DT that/DT financial/DT markets/DT are/DT not/DT yet/DT sufficiently/DT coordinated/DT to/DT handle/DT another/DT meltdown/DT in/DT prices/DT ./DT
No/DT fiddling/DT with/DT systems/DT and/DT procedures/DT will/DT ever/DT prevent/DT markets/DT from/DT suffering/DT a/DT panic/DT wave/DT of/DT selling/DT ./DT
But/DT markets/DT can/DT operate/DT with/DT greater/DT or/DT lesser/DT efficiency/DT ./DT
After/DT the/DT 1987/DT plunge/DT ,/DT markets/DT agreed/DT that/DT it/DT would/DT be/DT wise/DT to/DT halt/DT trading/DT whenever/DT panic/DT conditions/DT arose/DT ./DT

The/DT rationale/DT is/DT that/DT an/DT interruption/DT of/DT trading/DT will/DT allow/DT investors/DT to/DT reconsider/DT their/DT strategies/DT ,/DT calm/DT sellers/DT and/DT lead/DT buyers/DT to/DT enter/DT the/DT market/DT at/DT indicated/DT new/DT price/DT levels/DT ./DT

A/DT temporary/DT cessation/DT of/DT trading/DT may/DT indeed/DT discourage/DT a/DT selling/DT panic/DT from/DT feeding/DT on/DT itself/DT ./DT

What/DT happened/DT Friday/DT was/DT the/DT worst/DT of/DT all/DT worlds/DT ./DT
The/DT futures/DT exchanges/DT followed/DT their/DT own/DT pre-set/DT circuit/DT breakers/DT and/DT shut/DT down/DT at/DT about/DT 3/DT p.m./DT for/DT 30/DT minutes/DT ,/DT after/DT the/DT Standard/DT &/DT Poor/DT 's/DT 500/DT stock/DT index/DT had/DT fallen/DT 12/DT points/DT ,/DT or/DT about/DT 100/DT points/DT on/DT the/DT Dow/DT Jones/DT index/DT ./DT

The/DT New/DT York/DT Stock/DT Exchange/DT ,/DT under/DT its/DT own/DT rules/DT ,/DT remained/DT open/DT ./DT

As/DT liquidity/DT on/DT that/DT market/DT weakened/DT ,/DT prices/DT fell/DT sharply/DT ./DT
Had/DT the/DT futures/DT and/DT options/DT markets/DT been/DT open/DT ,/DT additional/DT liquidity/DT would/DT have/DT been/DT provided/DT and/DT the/DT decline/DT ,/DT most/DT probably/DT ,/DT would/DT have/DT been/DT less/DT intense/DT ./DT
At/DT 3:30/DT ,/DT after/DT intense/DT telephone/DT negotiations/DT between/DT the/DT trading/DT markets/DT and/DT Washington/DT ,/DT the/DT futures/DT exchanges/DT reopened/DT ./DT

Traders/DT can/DT vary/DT their/DT strategies/DT and/DT execute/DT their/DT orders/DT in/DT any/DT one/DT of/DT them/DT ./DT
It/DT therefore/DT makes/DT no/DT sense/DT for/DT each/DT market/DT to/DT adopt/DT different/DT circuit/DT breakers/DT ./DT
To/DT achieve/DT maximum/DT liquidity/DT and/DT minimize/DT price/DT volatility/DT ,/DT either/DT all/DT markets/DT should/DT be/DT open/DT to/DT trading/DT or/DT none/DT ./DT
Synchronized/DT circuit/DT breakers/DT would/DT not/DT have/DT halted/DT the/DT slide/DT in/DT prices/DT on/DT Friday/DT ,/DT but/DT they/DT probably/DT would/DT have/DT made/DT for/DT smoother/DT ,/DT less/DT volatile/DT executions/DT ./DT
It/DT 's/DT time/DT for/DT the/DT exchanges/DT and/DT the/DT Securities/DT and/DT Exchange/DT Commission/DT to/DT agree/DT on/DT joint/DT conditions/DT for/DT halting/DT trading/DT or/DT staying/DT open/DT ./DT

To/DT the/DT extent/DT that/DT Friday/DT 's/DT sell-off/DT reflected/DT a/DT sudden/DT reappraisal/DT of/DT the/DT excesses/DT of/DT leverage/DT ,/DT the/DT message/DT is/DT that/DT Wall/DT Street/DT and/DT the/DT private/DT markets/DT are/DT fully/DT capable/DT of/DT imposing/DT the/DT appropriate/DT incentives/DT and/DT sanctions/DT on/DT corporate/DT behavior/DT ./DT

If/DT you/DT identify/DT with/DT the/DT besieged/DT managers/DT ,/DT you/DT must/DT concede/DT that/DT speedy/DT and/DT effective/DT relief/DT from/DT the/DT excesses/DT of/DT the/DT takeover/DT market/DT is/DT more/DT likely/DT to/DT come/DT from/DT the/DT marketplace/DT than/DT from/DT Washington/DT ./DT

What/DT else/DT is/DT one/DT to/DT make/DT of/DT the/DT whacky/DT save-the-earth/DT initiative/DT just/DT proposed/DT by/DT several/DT major/DT environmental/DT groups/DT and/DT organized/DT by/DT the/DT state/DT 's/DT attorney/DT general/DT ?/DT

The/DT initiative/DT is/DT based/DT largely/DT on/DT the/DT wish-lists/DT of/DT the/DT green/DT lobby/DT :/DT the/DT Sierra/DT Club/DT ,/DT the/DT League/DT of/DT Conservation/DT Voters/DT ,/DT the/DT Natural/DT Resources/DT Defense/DT Council/DT ,/DT the/DT National/DT Toxics/DT Campaign/DT and/DT the/DT Citizens/DT for/DT a/DT Better/DT Environment/DT ./DT

Not/DT only/DT Californians/DT but/DT all/DT Americans/DT would/DT pay/DT if/DT this/DT thing/DT passed/DT ./DT
The/DT initiative/DT bars/DT the/DT sale/DT of/DT any/DT crops/DT in/DT California/DT that/DT do/DT n't/DT meet/DT the/DT initiative/DT 's/DT standards/DT ./DT
Kansas/DT wheat/DT farmers/DT and/DT Florida/DT fruit/DT growers/DT would/DT have/DT to/DT adjust/DT or/DT give/DT up/DT the/DT California/DT market/DT ./DT
In/DT other/DT words/DT ,/DT California/DT is/DT presuming/DT to/DT take/DT control/DT of/DT the/DT nation/DT 's/DT farm/DT policy/DT ./DT
As/DT usual/DT the/DT green/DT lobby/DT 's/DT proposal/DT is/DT disconnected/DT from/DT scientific/DT reality/DT ./DT
Consider/DT the/DT greenhouse-effect/DT provision/DT ./DT
The/DT proposed/DT initiative/DT would/DT mandate/DT a/DT reduction/DT of/DT carbon/DT dioxide/DT of/DT 40/DT %/DT ./DT
Even/DT if/DT one/DT buys/DT into/DT the/DT whole/DT greenhouse/DT theory/DT ,/DT it/DT is/DT inconceivable/DT that/DT reductions/DT in/DT a/DT single/DT state/DT could/DT have/DT any/DT impact/DT on/DT what/DT is/DT billed/DT as/DT a/DT global/DT problem/DT ./DT
But/DT if/DT rational/DT science/DT and/DT economics/DT have/DT nothing/DT to/DT do/DT with/DT the/DT new/DT environment/DT initiative/DT ,/DT what/DT is/DT going/DT on/DT ?/DT
The/DT first/DT place/DT to/DT look/DT under/DT these/DT circumstances/DT is/DT at/DT the/DT ways/DT in/DT which/DT the/DT sponsors/DT themselves/DT will/DT benefit/DT ./DT
The/DT key/DT here/DT is/DT the/DT ambition/DT of/DT state/DT Attorney/DT General/DT John/DT Van/DT de/DT Kamp/DT ./DT
He/DT 's/DT running/DT for/DT governor/DT ./DT
Mr./DT Van/DT de/DT Kamp/DT is/DT the/DT one/DT who/DT collected/DT the/DT plans/DT from/DT the/DT various/DT radical/DT environmental/DT groups/DT and/DT cobbled/DT them/DT into/DT a/DT single/DT unwieldy/DT initiative/DT to/DT be/DT placed/DT on/DT the/DT ballot/DT for/DT election/DT on/DT Nov./DT 6/DT ,/DT 1990/DT ./DT
That/DT 's/DT also/DT the/DT day/DT of/DT the/DT gubernatorial/DT election/DT ./DT
The/DT initiative/DT seems/DT to/DT have/DT been/DT crafted/DT to/DT include/DT all/DT the/DT hot/DT issues/DT that/DT set/DT off/DT the/DT wealthy/DT Hollywood/DT weepers/DT who/DT donate/DT money/DT ./DT
And/DT it/DT allows/DT Mr./DT Van/DT de/DT Kamp/DT to/DT get/DT around/DT campaign/DT spending/DT limits/DT ./DT
He/DT can/DT spend/DT the/DT legal/DT maximum/DT for/DT his/DT campaign/DT ;/DT all/DT the/DT spending/DT for/DT the/DT Van/DT de/DT Kamp/DT initiative/DT (/DT on/DT which/DT there/DT are/DT no/DT limits/DT )/DT is/DT gravy/DT ./DT
This/DT initiative/DT is/DT being/DT labeled/DT The/DT Big/DT Green/DT ,/DT but/DT maybe/DT it/DT should/DT be/DT called/DT The/DT Big/DT Greenback/DT ./DT

While/DT it/DT is/DT possible/DT that/DT the/DT Big/DT Green/DT initiative/DT will/DT be/DT ruled/DT unconstitutional/DT ,/DT it/DT is/DT of/DT course/DT conceivable/DT that/DT in/DT modern/DT California/DT it/DT could/DT slide/DT through/DT ./DT
This/DT is/DT the/DT state/DT that/DT recently/DT passed/DT the/DT Prop./DT 65/DT anti-toxic/DT initiative/DT ./DT
If/DT this/DT new/DT proposal/DT ever/DT does/DT become/DT law/DT ,/DT the/DT green/DT lobby/DT will/DT benefit/DT directly/DT ./DT
The/DT initiative/DT creates/DT a/DT free/DT floating/DT state/DT environmental/DT officer/DT to/DT sue/DT companies/DT or/DT government/DT agencies/DT that/DT do/DT things/DT he/DT does/DT n't/DT like/DT ./DT
That/DT means/DT the/DT NRDC/DT and/DT such/DT groups/DT no/DT longer/DT would/DT have/DT to/DT spend/DT as/DT much/DT money/DT on/DT litigation/DT ;/DT taxpayers/DT would/DT bear/DT the/DT cost/DT ./DT
Mr./DT Van/DT de/DT Kamp/DT and/DT his/DT allies/DT may/DT be/DT hoping/DT that/DT the/DT environment/DT is/DT such/DT a/DT mom/DT and/DT apple-pie/DT issue/DT among/DT certain/DT segments/DT of/DT California/DT 's/DT population/DT now/DT that/DT almost/DT any/DT collection/DT of/DT anti-scientific/DT ,/DT anti-pocketbook/DT nonsense/DT can/DT pass/DT under/DT its/DT rubric/DT ./DT
Of/DT course/DT the/DT state/DT 's/DT liberals/DT are/DT not/DT yet/DT a/DT nation/DT unto/DT themselves/DT ./DT
George/DT Bush/DT ,/DT for/DT example/DT ,/DT may/DT decide/DT that/DT he/DT does/DT n't/DT want/DT to/DT be/DT the/DT President/DT who/DT lost/DT control/DT of/DT interstate/DT commerce/DT to/DT an/DT attorney/DT general/DT from/DT California/DT ./DT
And/DT some/DT other/DT segments/DT of/DT California/DT 's/DT political/DT and/DT media/DT culture/DT may/DT yet/DT start/DT to/DT point/DT out/DT that/DT the/DT initiative/DT would/DT impose/DT significant/DT costs/DT on/DT the/DT state/DT 's/DT less/DT affluent/DT citizens/DT in/DT the/DT form/DT of/DT higher/DT food/DT prices/DT and/DT lost/DT jobs/DT ./DT
This/DT grandiose/DT initiative/DT will/DT help/DT California/DT define/DT itself/DT for/DT the/DT future/DT either/DT as/DT a/DT state/DT still/DT tethered/DT to/DT economic/DT and/DT scientific/DT reality/DT ,/DT or/DT as/DT one/DT being/DT led/DT to/DT wherever/DT its/DT la-la/DT activists/DT want/DT to/DT take/DT it/DT ./DT

The/DT Dow/DT Jones/DT Industrial/DT Average/DT opened/DT down/DT 1.64/DT shortly/DT after/DT 9:30/DT ./DT

The/DT Dow/DT dropped/DT to/DT a/DT quick/DT 27-point/DT loss/DT ,/DT and/DT to/DT many/DT traders/DT it/DT looked/DT as/DT if/DT stocks/DT were/DT headed/DT for/DT yet/DT another/DT big/DT tumble/DT ./DT

The/DT Butler/DT ,/DT Wis./DT ,/DT manufacturer/DT went/DT public/DT at/DT $/DT 15.75/DT a/DT share/DT in/DT August/DT 1987/DT ,/DT and/DT Mr./DT Sim/DT 's/DT goal/DT then/DT was/DT a/DT $/DT 29/DT per-share/DT price/DT by/DT 1992/DT ./DT
Strong/DT earnings/DT growth/DT helped/DT achieve/DT that/DT price/DT far/DT ahead/DT of/DT schedule/DT ,/DT in/DT August/DT 1988/DT ./DT
The/DT stock/DT has/DT since/DT softened/DT ,/DT trading/DT around/DT $/DT 25/DT a/DT share/DT last/DT week/DT and/DT closing/DT yesterday/DT at/DT $/DT 23.00/DT in/DT national/DT over-the-counter/DT trading/DT ./DT
But/DT Mr./DT Sim/DT has/DT set/DT a/DT fresh/DT target/DT of/DT $/DT 50/DT a/DT share/DT by/DT the/DT end/DT of/DT
Reaching/DT that/DT goal/DT ,/DT says/DT Robert/DT T./DT Foote/DT ,/DT Applied/DT 's/DT chief/DT financial/DT officer/DT ,/DT will/DT require/DT ``/DT efficient/DT reinvestment/DT ''/DT of/DT cash/DT by/DT Applied/DT and/DT continuation/DT of/DT its/DT healthy/DT 19/DT %/DT rate/DT of/DT return/DT on/DT operating/DT capital/DT ./DT
In/DT Barry/DT Wright/DT ,/DT Mr./DT Sim/DT sees/DT a/DT situation/DT ``/DT very/DT similar/DT ''/DT to/DT the/DT one/DT he/DT faced/DT when/DT he/DT joined/DT Applied/DT as/DT president/DT and/DT chief/DT operating/DT officer/DT in/DT 1985/DT ./DT
Applied/DT ,/DT then/DT a/DT closely/DT held/DT company/DT ,/DT was/DT stagnating/DT under/DT the/DT management/DT of/DT its/DT controlling/DT family/DT ./DT

Mr./DT Sim/DT is/DT confident/DT that/DT the/DT drive/DT to/DT dominate/DT certain/DT niche/DT markets/DT will/DT work/DT at/DT Barry/DT Wright/DT as/DT it/DT has/DT at/DT Applied/DT ./DT
He/DT also/DT professes/DT an/DT ``/DT evangelical/DT ''/DT fervor/DT to/DT develop/DT a/DT corporate/DT culture/DT that/DT rewards/DT managers/DT who/DT produce/DT and/DT where/DT decision-making/DT is/DT shared/DT ./DT
Mr./DT Sim/DT considers/DT the/DT new/DT unit/DT 's/DT operations/DT ``/DT fundamentally/DT sound/DT ''/DT and/DT adds/DT that/DT Barry/DT Wright/DT has/DT been/DT fairly/DT successful/DT in/DT moving/DT into/DT markets/DT that/DT have/DT n't/DT interested/DT larger/DT competitors/DT ./DT
``/DT With/DT a/DT little/DT patience/DT ,/DT these/DT businesses/DT will/DT perform/DT very/DT satisfactorily/DT ,/DT ''/DT Mr./DT Sim/DT says/DT ./DT
Within/DT about/DT six/DT months/DT ,/DT ``/DT things/DT will/DT be/DT moving/DT in/DT the/DT right/DT direction/DT ,/DT ''/DT he/DT predicts/DT ./DT
Mr./DT Sim/DT figures/DT it/DT will/DT be/DT easier/DT to/DT turn/DT Barry/DT Wright/DT around/DT since/DT he/DT 's/DT now/DT in/DT the/DT driver/DT 's/DT seat/DT ./DT
When/DT he/DT came/DT to/DT Applied/DT ,/DT ``/DT I/DT did/DT n't/DT have/DT the/DT power/DT to/DT execute/DT as/DT I/DT do/DT today/DT ,/DT ''/DT he/DT says/DT ./DT
